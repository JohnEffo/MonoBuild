### Other resources

The USP for *Monobuild* is that for Dotnet it will automatically detect the dependencies of a project, so you have less configuration to do. But the idea is not new if this tool does not do what you need consider looking at the [awsome list](https://github.com/korfuri/awesome-monorepo#build-systems--dependency-management-tools) of tools which also has some [articles](https://github.com/korfuri/awesome-monorepo#good-reads) on why you might use a Monopro in the first place.

### These tools share the same name:

* [Monobuild](https://github.com/charypar/monobuild) looks like it does a similar job to this package without auto discovery
* [Monobuild](https://github.com/monobuild/monobuild) a Go based program which describes itself as a tool to build software within a mono repository. Though you might use monobuild to run the build it self it is best combined with another build tool like task or make
